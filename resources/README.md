### What is AWS

Data centers distributed Worldwide
On-demand delivery of IT resources 
Shared and dedicated resources

Benefits:
- economies of scale
- accounts isolated at the hypervisor level
- pay-as-you-go pricing
- no up front cost
- reduced maintenance and admin costs
- organised into product categories

Divided into geographic **regions**, chosen in order to:
- optimise latency,
- minimise costs,
- address regulatory requirements.

Each further divided into **availability zones**:
- physically isolated from each other,
- connected to each other with fast, private fiber-optic networking.

To deliver content to end users with lower latency, **Amazon CloudFront** (fast content delivery network (CDN)) uses a global network of 187 Points of Presence (176 **Edge Locations** and 11 Regional Edge Caches) in 69 cities across 30 countries.
- caches content at edge locations for high performance delivery of content
- provides DDoS protection

### Cloud Computing Models
![Cloud Models](images/Cloud-Models.png)

#### IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT
Eg. VPC, EC2, EBS

#### PaaS: Platform as a Service
AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (usually hw and os)
Eg. RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch

#### SaaS: Software as a Service
Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. Mostly refers to end-user applications
Eg. Web-based email, Office 365, Salesforce

#### FaaS: Function as a Service or Serverless Computing
Allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. 
Eg. S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS

## Ways of interacting with AWS

1. Management Console
2. Software Development Kits (SDKs) for diverse programming languages
3. AWS REST API through HTTP requests
4. AWS CLI
